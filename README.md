- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... [Introduction To Wireframing](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-wireframing")
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ... different ways to learn Back-End, like Java, JavaScript/ECMAScript, PHP, and Ruby.
- 👩🏾‍💻 I’m looking for help with ... the final steps of bringing my [portfolio website](https://github.com/Ahttps://github.com/Angelfirenze01/intothecode01.io) live.  Something about the end stages isn't clicking.  I can deploy Heroku and Meteor, but not New Relic, and I likely need help with learning how to FTP.
